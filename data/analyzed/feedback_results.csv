trading bulletin31 july 2025nifty 5024 768 35 86 70 1 day 15 min timeframenifty opened with a big gap down of more than 100 points after the trump tariff decision after this it took support near 24 650 levels and it started rising from 10 15 am this went on till 2 pm where nifty made a high of around 24 950 levels after that it fell nearly 200 points in the next one and half hour levels to watch for tomorrow 24 900 upside 24 653 downside 4 hrs timeframeon the 4 hour timeframe nifty continues to show consolidation in the defined range this can be a very tight range the last candle on this timeframe is a gravestone doji which indicates some bearishness there is a crisp doji forming on weekly timeframe which also indicates higher indecision in the market global markets s p 500 closed flat as investors digested mixed earnings reports and remained cautious ahead of upcoming economic data and potential federal reserve decisions nikkei 225 rose supported by strong performances in financial and technology stocks along with a weaker yen that boosted export oriented companies kospi fell slightly due to profit taking and concerns over potential u s tariff measures which led to a muted session hang seng fell pressured by declines in chinese tech stocks and ongoing policy uncertainties dax fell weighed down by disappointing earnings reports and concerns over potential trade tensions which dampened market sentiment options data insightsnifty 50strong support at 24 700 there is a notable put oi buildup at the 24 700 strike indicating a firm support zone as traders look to defend this level resistance at 24 900 a strong accumulation of call oi is visible at the 24 900 strike making it a clear resistance zone where sellers are actively positioning long unwinding below 24 800 nifty is hovering below 24 800 with significant put oi around this strike if it sustains below this level it may trigger long unwinding as downside pressure builds pcr at 0 90 the put call ratio of 0 90 reflects a slightly bullish sentiment put writers are seen building positions at key support levels indicating confidence though resistance remains heavy overhead usually a put call ratio of 1 is neutral 0 5 suggests an oversold market and 1 5 indicates an overbought market india vix and nifty volatilityindia vix rose to 11 54 reflecting a 2 94 gain suggesting very low short term volatility historically india vix ranges between 12 and 25 levels above 20 indicate higher volatility and market stress while levels below 15 suggest low volatility nifty atm iv surged to 12 13 indicating very low volatility for nifty options in the near term with an iv change of 1 40 a lower iv suggests that traders expect smaller price movements which usually results in lower option premiums concept of the daybuying naked call optionit is a option strategy used when a trader expects a strong upside movement in the price of the underlying asset it involves purchasing a call option without any offsetting position allowing unlimited profit potential while limiting risk to the premium paid the goal of this strategy is to capitalize on strong bullish momentum and breakout moves scenario and example a naked call buying strategy was well suited for today s market conditions where nifty showed a swift recovery after the gap downfor instance when nifty opened with a gap down a trader could have capitalized on the move by going long after a breakout above the first 15 minute candle the trade could be managed with a trailing stop loss targeting 24 959 a resistance level on the higher timeframe an in the money call option with a high delta would have been an ideal instrument for this setup buy call option of 24 500 strike to benefit from strong directional movement this strategy profits from sustained upside momentum making it effective in trending markets where breakouts continue without major pullbacks chart of the day challengethis pattern appeared on the 1 d chart of hdfc

Anthropic’s $170B Valuation Tests Its Soul",,the atlas by generative ai by generative ai read this article on linkedin to join the conversation read on linkedin can ai models stay safe while their makers chase the world s richest and most controversial investors anthropic is chasing a 170b valuation backed by oil wealth and elite capital the company s safety first image is now clashing with the realities of funding scale this week in ai investments tesla signed a 16 5b chip deal with samsung to fuel its ai6 systems powering self driving cars humanoid robots and data center training in one unified stack microsoft and meta are under growing pressure from investors to justify their massive ai spend as margins tighten and scrutiny sharpens and sundar pichai quietly passed the 1b net worth mark as alphabet doubles down with 85b in ai capex the valuation is soaring the moral footing is what s starting to shake in today s generative ai newsletter anthropic seeks 5b at a 170b valuation amid ethical scrutiny tesla signs 16 5b chip deal with samsung for next gen ai6 systems microsoft and meta face investor pushback on ai spending sundar pichai hits 1 1b net worth as alphabet doubles down on ai anthropic s moral compass faces its toughest test at a 170b valuation credits anthropic anthropic is in talks to raise 3b to 5b at a staggering 170b valuation nearly tripling its worth in under six months the deal is being led by iconiq capital with middle eastern sovereign wealth funds circling in it would mark one of the largest private raises in ai history and put anthropic just behind openai in market value founded by ex openai execs dario and daniela amodei anthropic has grown from 10m in 2022 to an estimated 4b in revenue this year commanding a wild 42 5x multiple despite holding less than 4 percent of the ai market the company s claude models are known for their safety first design using a self imposed framework called constitutional ai that embeds principles like honesty and harmlessness into the model s core behavior that s been a selling point for risk averse sectors like healthcare and law but building responsible ai is expensive with 3b in annual burn anthropic is now leaning on oil rich backers to stay in the race in a leaked memo amodei admitted he s not thrilled about taking money from authoritarian regimes writing no bad person should ever benefit from our success is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on anthropic s challenge is bigger than scale it s trying to grow without losing its moral compass in an industry where speed often outruns caution the valuation may look clean on paper but the ethical compromises are already smudging the margins microsoft and meta face investor heat over ai spending surge ap photo jeff chiu microsoft and meta are now in the hot seat forced to defend sky high spending as wall street starts asking harder questions the next calls to report earnings will cover more than just results they re about strategy accountability and how long investors will tolerate billion dollar bets on an ai future that s still being coded microsoft s ai blitz has been fueled by its deep integration with openai pushing azure to the front of the cloud race and nudging its market cap toward 4 trillion but that alliance now faces friction openai is exploring outside partners and even a potential public listing meanwhile microsoft is on pace to spend an estimated 80b this fiscal year to build ai capacity a number that s already cutting into its cloud margins and triggering layoffs tied to cost control investors want clarity on what all this capital buys and how fast it pays off meta despite strong stock performance is still battling the ghost of the metaverse ceo mark zuckerberg now needs to prove that ai is doing more than juicing reels and optimizing ads shareholders want concrete gains in monetization not another long haul moonshot meta s push toward open source ai puts it at odds with microsoft s vertical model and both paths carry different financial risks the ai arms race is far from over but the financing honeymoon might be with trillions in valuation on the line investor tolerance now hinges on one metric return tesla locks 16 5b chip deal with samsung for next gen ai ambitions image credits marc piasecki tesla has inked a 16 5b chipmaking deal with samsung securing the production of its next generation ai6 chip the chips will be manufactured at samsung s massive new texas fab which elon musk described as strategically critical and conveniently located not far from my house the ai6 chip is built to handle tesla s full ai ecosystem it will power full self driving supervised in tesla vehicles drive the company s optimus humanoid robots and train models inside tesla s data centers it s an all in one architecture designed to unify tesla s ai stack across machines and environments musk hinted the eventual spend could exceed 16 5b stating actual output is likely to be several times higher samsung s fab will get direct support from tesla to optimize manufacturing according to musk tesla engineers will work alongside samsung to boost output as part of a deeper integration between the two companies tesla is also working with tsmc on a separate chip the ai5 which just completed design it will enter production first in taiwan then at tsmc s arizona plant samsung currently manufactures the ai4 chips tesla uses for older systems tesla s move to custom chips began in 2019 with its fsd computer hardware 3 also built by samsung since then chip design has become core to tesla s shift toward robotics and autonomy with this partnership tesla is solidifying its vision for a fully integrated ecosystem building not just the vehicles and robots but the

company betting 85 billion on an ai future sundar pichai just marked a decade as alphabet ceo with a fresh seat in the billionaire club his rise powered not by salary but by stock and strategy pichai s pay fell to 10 7m last year a steep drop from his 226m haul in 2022 but the real story is his stake in alphabet the company s stock jumped 4 1 after a 28 2b profit and 96 4b revenue in q2 2024 lifting pichai s net worth past 1 1b his 0 02 slice of alphabet now outpaces his paycheck and the firm is only doubling down capital expenditures will hit 85b next year most of it on ai that spend is

upside is broken this can be a very tight range the last candle on this timeframe is a gravestone doji which indicates some bearishness on the daily timeframe the chart shows some possibilities of a recovery till 25 600 levels but there are a lot of resistance levels in between 25 000 25 219 while 24 600 is a major level on this timeframe due to a trendline coming from few previous swing lows global markets s p 500 closed flat snapping its six day winning streak investors digested mixed earnings reports and awaited further economic data inflation concerns were offset by strong corporate

buildup at the 24 900 strike highlights stiff resistance with sellers actively defending this zone rangebound near 24 850 with almost similar oi on both calls and puts at 24 850 nifty may remain rangebound in the immediate term unless a breakout occurs pcr at 0 78 the put call ratio of 0 78 points to a neutral to bearish bias while put writers are present at key lower levels call writers have the upper hand at higher strikes usually a put call ratio of 1 is neutral 0 5 suggests an oversold market and 1 5 indicates an overbought market india vix and nifty volatilityindia vix fell to 11 21 reflecting a 2 78 dip suggesting very low short term volatility historically india vix ranges between 12 and 25 levels above 20 indicate higher volatility and market stress while levels below 15 suggest low volatility nifty atm iv rose to 9 78 indicating very low volatility for nifty options in the near term with an iv change of 5 93 a lower iv suggests that traders expect smaller price movements which usually results in lower option premiums fii and dii trendstoday s update fiis 850 cr diis 1 829 crforeign institutional investors fiis recorded a net outflow of 850 crore today showing a continued selling trend meanwhile domestic institutional investors diis remained strong with a net inflow of 1 829 crore today this brings the total fii outflow for july 2025 to 42 077 crore while diis have recorded a cumulative net inflow of 54 566 crore in july 2025 concept of the dayshort straddleit is a options strategy where a trader sells both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date it profits from low volatility expecting the underlying asset to stay near the strike price the strategy carries unlimited risk if the price moves significantly in either direction strong risk management is necessary scenario and example a short straddle was well suited for today s market conditions as nifty consolidated within a range and hovered near the 24 850 level throughout the day for example with nifty trading around 24 850 a short straddle could involve sell 24 850 put option sell 24 850 call optionthis strategy profits the most if nifty stays

new member on the international space station and it doesn t eat sleep or need a space suit cimon a floating ai assistant built by airbus and ibm is now helping astronauts with lab tasks camera operations and autonomous decision making roughly the size of a bowling ball cimon looks more like sci fi than real life but it s already supporting real missions speaking and responding to crew members with voice commands and facial recognition this week jaxa astronaut takuya onishi tested cimon s ability to coordinate with a free floating robotic camera using only spoken commands to locate an object in japan s kibo module the experiment is part of japan s ichiban project which explores whether ai systems can relieve astronauts of routine burdens like system checks and documentation giving them more time for hands on science nasa is observing how cimon interprets instructions navigates space and interacts with other robots in real time the long term aim is to develop ai systems that can act as copilots for missions far from earth where communication delays and psychological strain pose real risks from managing repairs to offering conversational support during months of isolation these floating assistants could become mission critical crew members on trips to mars lunar bases and beyond if humanity is going interstellar it won t be alone machines like cimon are

it gained after that till 10 am but faced some resistance near 24 730 levels and fell the fall continued for the next 1h and it again took support near the same levels nifty started rising after this in a higher high and higher low pattern around 2 30 pm it faced resistance near 24 829 levels shared yesterday it fell and then eventually it closed near these levels only key levels to watch for tomo 24 737 downside 24 888 upside 4 hrs timeframeon the 4 hour timeframe nifty saw a drift recovery from the levels we mentioned yesterday while this still doesn t mean that it is in a bullish territory it still looks weak a close above 24 959 is necessary for some short term upside movement and the structure will only be better if nifty trades above 25 210 while on the downside 24 539 is very important global markets s p 500 closed flat as investors digested mixed earnings reports and awaited further economic data inflation concerns were offset by strong corporate results keeping the market largely unchanged nikkei 225 fell today pressured by a stronger yen and profit taking after recent gains the index had hit a record high earlier in the week but investors opted to lock in

weakness in some chinese tech stocks dax rose today buoyed by positive earnings reports and improving investor sentiment amid easing trade tensions options data insightsnifty 50strong support at 24 700 a substantial buildup of put open interest at the 24 700 strike suggests this level is acting as a key support resistance at 24 900 heavy call open interest accumulation at the 24 900 strike indicates strong resistance with sellers likely to defend this zone unless strong momentum breaks through rangebound near 24 850 with both call and put oi nearly balanced at the 24 850 level nifty may trade sideways around this zone unless a breakout is triggered on either side pcr at 0 71 the put call ratio of 0 71 signals a bearish bias call writing remains dominant at higher strikes indicating limited upside expectations in the near term usually a put call ratio of 1 is neutral 0 5 suggests an oversold market and 1 5 indicates an overbought market india vix and nifty volatilityindia vix fell to 11 53 reflecting a 4 39 dip suggesting very low short term volatility historically india vix ranges between 12 and 25 levels above 20 indicate higher volatility and market stress while levels below 15 suggest low volatility nifty atm iv dipped to 9 82 indicating very low volatility for nifty options in the near term with an iv change of 7 20 a lower iv suggests that traders expect smaller

significant net outflow of 4 636 crore on july 29 2025 this drags the total fii outflow for july to 41 227 crore indicating persistent foreign weakness despite nifty s positive momentum in contrast domestic institutional investors diis continued their strong buying activity recording a robust net inflow of 6 146 crore today with this monthly dii inflows now stand at 52 737 crore offering solid support to the markets and reflecting strong domestic conviction amid global uncertainty concept of the daybull call spreadit is a options strategy used when a trader expects a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset while limiting risk it involves buying a lower strike call option and simultaneously selling a higher strike call option with the same expiration date the goal of this strategy is to profit from a controlled upside movement while reducing cost compared to buying a single call option scenario and example a bull call spread was well suited for today s market conditions as nifty saw some upside movement for example with nifty trading around at 24 600 a bull call spread could involve buy 24 600 call option sell 24 800 call optionthis strategy profits if nifty sees some upside while keeping the risk limited making it an effective way to trade a moderate uptrend chart of the day challengethis pattern appeared on the 1d chart of orient technologiescan
